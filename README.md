Key Features:

Current Location Weather: The app automatically detects the user's current location using their device's geolocation feature and displays the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

City Weather Search: Users can enter the name of any city in the search bar to get weather updates for that specific location. The app fetches data from the OpenWeather API and presents the weather details of the requested city.

Weather Details: The Weather App presents detailed weather information, such as the current temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures for the day, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).

Responsive Design: The app is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Visual Representation: To enhance the user experience, the app includes visually appealing weather icons and background images that change based on the weather conditions of the displayed location.

Unit Conversion: Users can toggle between different unit systems, such as Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature, and metric and imperial for other measurements, providing flexibility to view weather data according to their preferences.

Technical Details:
The Weather App is developed using a combination of front-end technologies:

HTML: The structure of the app is created using HTML5, ensuring proper semantics and accessibility.

CSS: Styling is implemented using CSS3, focusing on creating an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user interface.

JavaScript: The app's dynamic functionality is built with JavaScript, which handles data retrieval from the OpenWeather API, user interactions, and real-time updates.

OpenWeather API: The app communicates with the OpenWeather API to obtain accurate and up-to-date weather data for the searched cities.

Asynchronous Requests: The app employs asynchronous programming techniques to ensure smooth data retrieval and display without blocking the user interface.

The Weather App is a personal project that showcases my proficiency in web development, specifically using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and data-driven application. The project demonstrates my ability to work with external APIs and handle real-time data while delivering an engaging user experience.

By developing the Weather App, I have honed my skills in front-end development, user interface design, and API integration.
